# 9.-An-Overtime-Program
 a program called “Timesheet”. The program should calculate
and display a worker’s total weekly pay as well as their average number of hours worked
per day, and their average pay per hour after overtime pay.
The user will be able to enter:
1. Number of hours worked per day, individually for five days.
2. Regular hourly wage rate.
The program will calculate the worker’s total weekly pay, the worker’s average number
of hours worked per day, and the average pay per hour including overtime pay for the
given week.
The weekly pay for up to 40 hours is calculated using the regular hourly weekly pay. If
the number of hours worked exceeds 40, the worker receives 150% (one-and-a-half
times) pay for the number of hours exceeding 40.
